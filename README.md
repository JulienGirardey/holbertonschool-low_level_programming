# Holberton Projects Summary

This repository contains various C projects I have worked on during my time at Holberton School. Below is a summary of the projects categorized by topics covered.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **argc and argv**
In these projects, I explored command-line arguments in C. Using `argc` and `argv`, I learned how to pass arguments to a program and how to process them. The main focus was on understanding how command-line input can influence the behavior of a C program.

### 2. **Functions and Nested Loops**
These projects involved the creation of functions to perform repetitive tasks, and the implementation of nested loops to handle more complex operations. This helped me understand how functions can be used to organize code and how nested loops can iterate over multi-dimensional data structures.

### 3. **Hello World**
The "Hello World" project introduced me to basic C syntax and the compilation process. It allowed me to learn how to structure a simple program, use the `printf` function, and compile and execute C code using the GCC compiler.

### 4. **Malloc and Free**
In these projects, I explored dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and the importance of freeing memory with `free`. I learned the significance of memory management in C programming and how improper memory allocation can lead to memory leaks and other issues.

### 5. **More Functions and Nested Loops**
Building on earlier projects, I further developed my understanding of functions and nested loops. I worked on projects that required creating more complex functions and managing more intricate loops. These projects helped me refine my skills in organizing code logically and efficiently.

### 6. **Pointers, Arrays, and Strings**
In these projects, I delved deeper into pointers and arrays, understanding their relationship in C programming. I also explored string manipulation and how to work with character arrays. This was essential for understanding memory management and efficient data handling in C.

### 7. **Recursion**
The recursion projects focused on understanding the concept of a function calling itself. I solved various problems using recursive techniques, which improved my problem-solving skills and helped me understand the deeper workings of function calls in C.

### 8. **Variables, If-Else, and While Loops**
These projects introduced me to basic control flow concepts such as `if-else` statements and `while` loops. I learned how to make decisions in code based on conditions and how to repeat actions until certain criteria were met. This formed the foundation for more advanced algorithms.
