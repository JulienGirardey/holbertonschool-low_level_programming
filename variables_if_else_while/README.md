# C - Variables, If, Else, While

## Resources

Read or watch:

- **Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf**  
  (You do not have to learn everything in there yet, but make sure you read it entirely first and understand the slides: “comments”, “Data types | Integer types”, “Declaration”, “Characters”, “Arithmetic operators”, “Variables assignments”, “Comparisons”, “Logical operators”, “if, if…else”, “while loops”.)
  
- **Keywords and identifiers**  
- **integers**
- **Arithmetic Operators in C**
- **If statements in C**
- **if…else statement**
- **Relational operators**
- **Logical operators**
- **while loop in C**
- **While loop**
  
man or help:
  
- **ascii**  
  (You do not need to learn about `scanf`, `getc`, `getchar`, `EOF`, `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `time`, `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX`, `for` loops, `do...while` loops, or functions.)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the relational operators are and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- How to use boolean operators
- How to use `if`, `if...else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop
- How to use variables with the `while` loop
- How to print variables using `printf`
- What the ASCII character set is
- The purpose of the gcc flags `-m32` and `-m64`

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use `system`
- Your code should use the **Betty style**. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- **Score:** 100.00%
- **Description:** This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive, zero, or negative.

### 1. The last digit
- **Score:** 100.00%
- **Description:** This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- **Score:** 100.00%
- **Description:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use `putchar` twice.

### 3. alphABET
- **Score:** 100.00%
- **Description:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. You can only use `putchar` three times.

### 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
- **Score:** 100.00%
- **Description:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Exclude the letters `q` and `e`. You can only use `putchar` twice.

### 5. Numbers
- **Score:** 100.00%
- **Description:** Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

### 6. Numberz
- **Score:** 100.00%
- **Description:** Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line. You are not allowed to use any variable of type `char`. You can only use `putchar` twice.

### 7. Smile in the mirror
- **Score:** 100.00%
- **Description:** Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. You can only use `putchar` twice.

### 8. Hexadecimal
- **Score:** 100.00%
- **Description:** Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use `putchar` three times.

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
- **Score:** 100.00%
- **Description:** Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by `,` followed by a space. You can only use `putchar` four times.
